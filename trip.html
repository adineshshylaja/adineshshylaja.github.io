         <br>I have always been fascinated by tulips every since I was a little girl and when I heard about the 90<sup>th</sup> <a>Tulip Time Festival</a> at Holland, Michigan, I knew
         that I would not want to miss this! Tulips only bloom once in a year from March through May. Holland is about 600 miles from Omaha so me and my husband(cant forget him!)
         decided to drive down. Once we reached we realised that this festival was not just about the millions of tulips that were planted and nurtured, it was also about
         the Dutch heritage at Holland! We were blown away by the variety and colors of tulips around us. There were plenty of food trucks, Dutch dancers, artisan markets
         and a big parade! Please goto <a target="blank" href="https://www.tuliptime.com/visit">Tulip Time Festival</a> for more details.
